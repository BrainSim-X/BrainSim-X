Equations :
BrainSim-X lies a complex activation function, designed to mirror biological synaptic responses. We define the neural activation 
as:  
BrainSim-X=f(i=1∑nWiXi+b)
 BrainSim-X → The final output, representing how the system processes and reacts to information, similar to a human 
brain. 
XiX_iXi → Input signals, like the sensory data our neurons receive. 
WiW_iWi → Synaptic weights that determine how important each input is, just like how some thoughts or sensations 
influence our decisions more than others. 
bbb → A bias term that helps the system activate even when the inputs are weak or minimal. 
f(x)f(x)f(x) → The activation function, which decides how strongly the system responds—just like neurons firing 
when they detect something important.
