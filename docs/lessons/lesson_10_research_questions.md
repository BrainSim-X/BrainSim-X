Lesson 10: Research Question & Proposal Writing 

10.1 How to Frame a Strong Research Problem 

Key Steps in Problem Formulation: 

 Identify the Gap: Determine what is known versus what remains to be investigated. 
 Establish Relevance: Contextualize the importance and implications of the research 
problem, emphasizing its significance in neuroscience or AI. 

SMART Criteria: A well-defined research question should be Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 

10.2 Writing a Structured AI + Neuroscience Proposal 

Proposal Structure: 

1. Introduction: Present background context and define objectives. 
2. Methods: Describe the methodology, including participant selection and analytical 
frameworks. 
3. Expected Outcomes: Discuss the potential significance of findings. 
Significance of Clarity: A clear narrative guides reviewers through the proposal, providing a 
well-articulated rationale for the research.
