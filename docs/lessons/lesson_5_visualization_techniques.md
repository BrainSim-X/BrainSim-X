Lesson 5: Advanced Visualization Techniques 

5.1 Using BrainView for Neuroimaging Visualization 

Importance of Visualization Tools: Effective visualization aids in interpreting complex 
neuroimaging data. Tools like BrainView facilitate: 

 Surface Mapping: Visualizing regions of the brain with respect to activation levels. 

 Functional Connectivity: Exploring how different brain regions interact based on 
simultaneous activity readings. 

5.2 Creating Interactive Neuroscience Dashboards 

Dashboard Components: Interactive dashboards integrate visualizations and analytical tools: 

 User Interface: Intuitive design with sliders, selection menus, and real-time updates 
tailored to user interactions. 

 Multi-layered Visualization: Capable of showcasing multiple data points 
simultaneously, enabling a comprehensive understanding of neural phenomena. 

5.3 Hands-on Implementation: Develop an Interactive Neuroimaging Heatmap 

import numpy as np 
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
# Simulated dataset representing brain activity across subjects and regions 
data = np.random.rand(10, 12)  # 10 brain regions, 12 subjects 
# Creating heatmap using seaborn 
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) 
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', cbar=True) 
plt.title('Interactive Neuroimaging Heatmap') 
plt.xlabel('Subjects') 
plt.ylabel('Brain Regions') 
plt.show() 

This heat map provides insights into brain activity distribution across different regions/functions, 
facilitating the observation of trends or outliers.
