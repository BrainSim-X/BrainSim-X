Lesson 9: Ethical Considerations in AI and Healthcare 

9.1 Bias in AI-Driven Medical Decisions 

Understanding Bias: Artificial intelligence can unintentionally reflect societal biases due to 
biased training data, leading to persistent inequalities in patient care. 
Types of Bias: 

1. Sampling Bias: When training datasets do not adequately represent the demographic 
diversity of the patient population.

3. Label Bias: Clinical annotations might be influenced by conscious or unconscious biases 
of practitioners, affecting the quality and reliability of training data.

Case Studies: Examining cases where AI systems have been shown to reinforce gender or racial 
biases underscores the perceived dangers of deploying these systems without careful oversight. 
9.2 Patient Privacy and AI Accountability 

Data Privacy Concerns: The sensitive nature of health data necessitates stringent measures to 
protect patient privacy, requiring alignment with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. 
Accountability in AI: Establishing clear accountability mechanisms for AI applications 
involves: 

 Transparent algorithms 
 Documented decision-making processes 
 Explainability to foster trust and compliance with ethical standards 

9.3 Hands-on Exercise: Case Study on AI Bias in Medical Diagnosis 

Research Exercise: Students analyze a documented case study detailing: 

1. Background: Description of the AI system and its intended use-case in healthcare. 
2. Identifying Bias: Examination of how bias manifested within the AI model. 
3. Proposed Solutions: Discussing strategies for mitigating bias, emphasizing the 
importance of inclusive data collection and continuous monitoring.
